## Overview and Origin

![pal_image](palantir.png)

* Palantir

* Founded in 2003 by Peter Thiel (co-founder of PayPal) as a start-up company, named after the fictional artifact in Tolkien’s “Lord of the Rings” series which allowed communication and observation in other parts of the world.

* Thiel saw an opportunity to apply software, similar to PayPal’s fraud recognition systems, that could be used to “reduce terrorism while preserving civil liberties.”

* 2003-2008 - Early investment from U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.
2010-2012 - Expansion of Palantir technologies as a Quantitative Analysis tool.
2013-2016 - Additional funding and clientele within the U.S. government including the S.E.C as well as investment firms such as Tiger Global Management.

## Business Activities:

* Essentially, Palantir’s software synthesises data that an organisation collects. It could be hundreds of types of data from tax records, phone numbers, photos, emails, text messages and any other information in all different formats and storages. Palantir is able to merge all the information into a single platform which can then be used to create:
Tables and graphs
Timelines
Diagrams
Program models 
And any other data assisted tools and present them in an elegant and easy to understand interface.

* The amalgamation of data is a struggle for many companies. Very often, as a company grows in scale, the complexity of data analysis grows exponentially. Being able to deliver a common operational picture, regardless of scale, can and has realised hundreds of millions of dollars in cost savings for large businesses.

* Palantir technology is a mix of big data analytics and machine learning which can be applied to any form of analysis. The product is designed for machine assisted, human driven analytics.

## Landscape:

* Palantir's main domain is Big Data Analytics. The application of their technology has been used in finance, security, manufacturing and many other areas of business.
Using Palantir, organisations have been assisted in doing works such as:
Investigators are uncovering human trafficking rings, locating exploited children and unravelling complex financial crimes.
Humanitarian response organisations are directing resources more effectively. 
Banking and investment firms are better able to guard against money laundering.
Prosecutors are building stronger cases against insider traders.
Information security specialists are better defending against theft of intellectual property, sensitive documents and personal information.
Public health officials are tracking and containing the spread of COVID19 and other deadly diseases

* Over the last 5-10 years, many companies are starting to understand the importance of "big data" but very few are able to capitalise on their data or apply it to any relevant part of their business. Palantir is different to other big data analytics as they are not collecting the data themselves but are able to best apply data that others have collected and apply it to solve a problem within the company.

* Other major companies in this domain are Facebook and Google. However, these companies differ as they collect their own data from their users and apply it to their own buinesses. Palantir is able to adapt to other businesses so they can also use this tech power to improve and grow their business in partnership.

## Results

* Palantir products are applicable to any institution with large volumes of data and an understanding of a problem they want to solve. The issue can be financial, operational, technical, workflow, marketing or any other reason either known or unseen. With sufficient data, nearly any problem can be solved.

* Since 2003, Palantir as a company has not been able to turn a profit and has actually lost money every year. Although revenue is increasing yearly, overhead costs are projected to be around 105% of the revenue value. Palantir is more at the forefront of adapting big data to any business that needs it. Although it is currently not profitable, as more and more partnerships are created and the cost of running Palantir becomes more streamlined, the company has a lot of potential future value.

* Compared to it's big tech brothers, Palantir is hardly competing with companies like Google and Facebook in terms of profitablity in the field of data analytics. However, as other big data analytics are focused on using their technology to better improve their own businesses, Palantir has an edge as they product can be applied to nearly any business worldwide and their potential market saturation could be much higher than all it's competitors combined.

## Recommendations

* My advice for Palantir would be to also create a product that could be adapted to smaller business rather than only the biggest companies in the world. While Palantir doesn't collect data themselves, they absolutely have the capability to do so and could also offer a product to smaller business that could assist them with collecting data that would be useful to their business.

* Offering this product would allow them to target small and medium sized business with a useful and user friendly product. The cost to offer this product would be low and it would help Palantir to become more profitable earlier by increasing their customer base.

* This additional product would utilise the same technologies that they already have, data collection, synthesis of data and machine learning

* These technologies are appropriate to this product as they would then lead on to applying this gained data to solving financial, operational and technical issues which can also be solved using Palantir's exisiting technologies.
